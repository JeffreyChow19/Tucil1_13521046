# 24-Cards-Game Solver using Brute Force Algorithm

The 24 card game is an arithmetic card game with the goal of finding ways to change four random numbers so that the final result is a total of 24. The game is quite popular due to its ability to improve counting skills and sharpen the mind to think quickly and accurately. The 24 Card Game is usually played using a deck of playing cards. Playing cards consist of 52 cards divided into four suits (spades, hearts, diamonds and clubs) each consisting of 13 cards (Ace, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, Jack, Queen, and King).

This program shows all possibility of operation combinations through 4 cards number so that the result of the expression could be equal to 24. Technically this program use Brute Force Algorithm to find the solutions.
